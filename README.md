## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently working on:
- Setting up **Homelab environments** using **Raspberry Pi** to learn and implement **networking** and **security** concepts.
- Automating my **network environment** and strengthening security measures in practical setups.
- **Documenting** my projects on **GitHub** to share my learning journey with the community.

## 🔧 Current Projects

### 🔐 [Raspberry Pi Homelab Setup](https://github.com/AJprogramming123/Raspberry-Pi)

This project involves setting up a **secure file-sharing system** using **Samba** over **Tailscale VPN**. I secured the Raspberry Pi with **Fail2Ban**, **firewalld**, and **SSH hardening** to ensure only authorized devices can access the network. This setup serves as a **self-hosted, private cloud storage** solution accessible anywhere via VPN.
