### 🚀 About Me

I'm passionate about building and securing infrastructures that work seamlessly. My interests span across:

- **System Administration** – Designing and automating secure, scalable environments.
- **DevOps Practices** – Implementing CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and automation.
- **Security Engineering** – Integrating robust security protocols into infrastructure.
- **Web & Software Development** – Applying backend and frontend skills to build real-world applications.

Everything I work on supports my goal of mastering the full technology stack — from the physical server to automated deployment pipelines.
